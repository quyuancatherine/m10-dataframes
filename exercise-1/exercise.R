# Exercise 2: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored the first 4 games of last season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores 2016")
seahawks.score <- c(12, 3, 37, 27)


# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
opponents.score <- c(10, 9, 18, 17)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
score <- data.frame(seahawks.score, opponents.score)


# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points


# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom


# Create a vector of the opponents


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
